Welcome to the README file for my virtual data science internship at BharatIntern. This document provides an overview of my internship experience, the tasks I completed, and the key takeaways.
During my virtual data science internship at BharatIntern, I had the opportunity to gain practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. The main objectives of the internship were:
1. To apply data science techniques to real-world problems.
2. To develop and enhance my data analysis and machine learning skills.
3. To work on meaningful projects that contribute to the company's goals.

### Task 1: Stock Price Prediction

- **Description**: In this task, I worked on predicting stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.
- **Key Accomplishments**:
  - Gathered and preprocessed historical stock price data.
  - Developed and trained an LSTM model for stock price prediction.
  - Evaluated model performance and made predictions.
- **Skills Gained**: Time series analysis, deep learning, model evaluation.

### Task 2: Titanic Classification

- **Description**: This task involved building a classification model to predict survival outcomes for passengers on the Titanic. It served as an introduction to classic binary classification problems.
- **Key Accomplishments**:
  - Preprocessed the Titanic dataset, handling missing values and categorical variables.
  - Developed and trained classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict survival.
  - Evaluated model performance and tuned hyperparameters.
- **Skills Gained**: Data preprocessing, binary classification, model selection and tuning.

## Key Learnings
During my internship, I acquired valuable skills and knowledge, including:
- Data collection and preprocessing techniques.
- Model selection, training, and evaluation.
- Handling real-world datasets with missing values and categorical features.
- Deep learning for time series forecasting.
- The importance of effective communication and documentation.
